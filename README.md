This is a Micro SD card reader module that runs on 3.3V and uses the SPI interface with the file system driver and microcontroller system to read and write files to the Micro SD card. For instance, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Raspberry Pi Pico, to name a few.

## For setup the Board in Thonny </b>
* Now connect USB Cable on USB Port of Pico.
* Open Thonny IDE and Choose interpreter as MicroPython (Raspberry Pi pico).

## Code
 In this file, you see two python files
 * sdcard.py -> this file contain the library of the sd card module, you need to save this file to pico
 * sd.py     -> this file you need to run, save this file to pico
